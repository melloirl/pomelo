# DESIGN.md — Neo‑Brutalism Design Instructions

## WHAT IS NEO‑BRUTALISM
Neo‑Brutalism is a modern web/UI design aesthetic descended from architectural Brutalism. It favors raw structure, clarity, and function over polish or decoration. The interface exposes its construction instead of hiding it.

## OVERALL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
1. Honesty and rawness: structure is visible, edges are explicit.
2. Function first: every element must justify its existence.
3. Hierarchy through weight: size, contrast, spacing, and borders define importance.
4. Architectural framing: layouts feel built, not decorated.

## COLOR GUIDELINES
- Prefer grayscale first: white, off‑white, light gray, dark gray, black.
- Use black for outlines, dividers, and emphasis.
- Avoid gradients, blurs, and transparency.
- When color is added later, use one accent color sparingly for actions or highlights.

## SHAPES & COMPONENTS
- Use raw geometric shapes with visible strokes.
- Borders should be thick and high‑contrast.
- Corners should be consistent: sharp or deliberately chunky.
- Shadows, if used, must be hard‑edged and opaque.
- Cards and sections should feel physical and boxed.

## TYPOGRAPHY
- Body text: highly legible, neutral sans‑serif.
- Headings: heavy, bold, industrial or grotesk in character.
- Large size jumps between hierarchy levels.
- Typography is part of layout, not decoration.

## LAYOUT & SPACING
- Use a strict, visible grid.
- Favor large, confident spacing.
- Allow asymmetry when it reinforces hierarchy.
- Navigation should be obvious and visible.

## IMAGERY
- Use images sparingly.
- No filters, overlays, or soft effects.
- Images should be framed clearly with borders.

## ACCESSIBILITY & UX
- Maintain strong contrast ratios.
- Keep text readable at all sizes.
- Make interactive elements obvious.
- Brutalism should never block usability.

## DO
- Emphasize structure.
- Use thick outlines.
- Make hierarchy unmistakable.
- Prefer clarity over elegance.

## DON’T
- Use gradients or glassmorphism.
- Hide structure behind decoration.
- Over‑animate.
- Use subtlety to communicate importance.

## OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS
When generating designs:
- Start in grayscale.
- Show hierarchy clearly.
- Favor structure over aesthetics.
- Treat layout as architecture.
